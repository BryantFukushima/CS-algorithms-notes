__#1 - If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:__
BFS

__#2 - If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:__
BFS (DFS would take longer)

__#3 - If the tree is very wide:__
DFS (BFS take more memory, stores all sibling nodes in memory)

__#4 - If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:__
DFS

__#5 - Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:__
DFS

__#6 - Finding the shortest path:__
BFS
